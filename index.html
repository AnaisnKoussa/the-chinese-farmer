        <h2>The story</h1>
        <p id="first">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said :</p>
        <q class="villagers"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate. </q>
        <p> The farmer said :</p>
        <q class="farmer"><em> Maybe. </em></q>
        <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said :</p>
        <q class="villagers"> Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses ! </q>
        <p>The farmer again said :</p>
        <q class="farmer"><em> Maybe. </em></q>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said :</p>
        <q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag>. </q>, 
        <p>and the farmer responded :</p>
        <q class="farmer"><em> Maybe. </em></q> 
        <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said :</p>
        <q class="villagers"> Isn’t that great ! </q> 
        <p>Again, he said :</p> 
        <q class="farmer"><em> Maybe. </em></q>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good">good</tag> fortune.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            <tag class="good">Good</tag> and <tag class="bad">bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag class="good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="good">good</tag> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
